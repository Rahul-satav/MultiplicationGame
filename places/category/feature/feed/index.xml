										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Stephen Starr creative Japanese restaurant has garnered all kinds of national and international attention since opening a few years back. Located a block from Independence Hall on Chestnut Street, Morimoto has an interior &#8211; awash in glass and colors &#8211; that is both striking and serene in its design.</p>
<p>	The restaurant&acute;s namesake and head chef, Morimoto (of Food Network&acute;s Iron Chef fame), has created a menu offering the very best in contemporary Japanese cusine. While regulars flock here for the exquisitely prepared sushi, Morimoto offers diners a broad spectrum of flavors that delve beyond nigiri and sashimi.</p>
<p>	In recent years, the restaurant has made it onto Gourmet magazine&acute;s “Best Restaurants in America” list and Conde Nast Traveler magazine 50 Hot Tables in America. Today Morimoto remains one of the hottest spots to dine in Center City and continues to receive rave reviews from regulars and first-timers alike.</p>
<p>	That said, be sure to call ahead for reservations.</p>
<h3>Insider Tip </h3>
<p>	The mezzanine level lounge is a great spot to have a pre-meal cocktail while waiting for your table. You can enjoy a sake or try a “Sakura” &#8211; a cosmo made with Sake &#8211; in the sleek space that overlooks the brilliant restaurant below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Percy Street Barbecue sees the South Street debut of restaurateurs Steven Cook and Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Xochitl).</p>
<p>	Serving a straightforward selection of slowly smoked meats and homey side dishes alongside craft beers and tasty cocktails, Percy Street is an ideal venue for Chef Erin OShea much-lauded Southern cooking, and is on its way to become the city top spot for barbecue.</p>
<p>	Working with J&#038;R smokers sourced from Texas, Chef O&acute;shea and her crack team of barbecue wizards headed down to Texas &#8211; tested no fewer than 20 beef briskets &#8211; as they perfected the ideal balance of salt, smoke and seasoning. Check out this video about their culinary field trip to the Lone Star State.</p>
<h3>The Eats </h3>
<p>	That Brisket which is Percy Street&acute;s signature dish, served &#8211; as is the custom in Texas &#8211; by the half pound or pound, in three distinct cuts: Moist, Lean and Burnt Ends.</p>
<p>	Other menu items include: Spare Ribs; house-made Sausage; half or whole Chicken; and Pork Belly, all slowly smoked and served with white bread and pickles. Sides, available small or large, include: Pinto Beans; Green Bean Casserole, Root beer Chili, Coleslaw; Collard Greens; Macaroni and Cheese; and Vegan Chili.</p>
<h3>The Drinks </h3>
<p>	In keeping with their bare-bones, Texas-frontier aesthetic, Percy Street&acute;s craft beers are served exclusively on draft at the poured concrete bar, lit from above by illuminated green glass beer growlers. Beers include Sly Fox Rauchbier (available in Pennsylvania exclusively at the restaurant) as well as a hand-crafted Root Beer from Yard&acute;s Brewing Company.</p>
<p>	Cocktails include: FM 423, with Tito handmade vodka, peach juice and sweet tea; Jack &#038; Ginger, with Jack Daniels, Canton ginger liqueur, lime cordial and ginger ale; and Cherry Cola, with Beam rye, cherry Heering, DiSaronno and cola.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere </h3>
<p>	Percy Street&acute;s simple, rustic decor was created by Elisabeth Knapp, who also designed Cook and Solomonov Xochitl and Zahav restaurants.</p>
<p>	Her frontier-influenced design focuses on the fire engine red smokers, visible through a window in the dining room and bar area. The restaurant features light wood floors, weathered red paint, a working jukebox and custom “blackboard walls,” large panels of schoolhouse blackboards that can be rearranged to create private dining areas throughout the 80-seat space.</p>
<p>	Seating in the form of repurposed church pews, and bare light bulbs overhead in the dining room lend to the restaurant Texas-esque aesthetic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Located in a Rittenhouse Square space evoking the free-wheeling spirit of a speakeasy, Village Whiskey is prolific Chef Jose Garces’ intimate, 30-seat tribute to the time-honored liquor.</p>
<p>	In fact, Village Whiskey features a veritable library of 80-100 varieties of whiskey, bourbon, rye and scotch from Scotland, Canada, Ireland, United States and even Japan.</p>
<p>	Much as Village Whiskey could be a scene for toasting and roasting, it also comes from the culinary imagination of Jose Garces (of Amada, Tinto, Distrito and Chifa fame), meaning the food is no less than outstanding.</p>
<h3>Cuisine </h3>
<p>	Village Whiskey&acute;s specialty from the kitchen is “bar snacks,” but that doesn&acute;t mean a bowl of cashews. Rather, it means deviled eggs, spicy popcorn shrimp, soft pretzels and an à la carte raw bar, all treated with the culinary care that made Jose Garces a finalist on The Next Iron Chef.</p>
<p>	Perhaps you seek something heartier. The lobster roll, raw bar selections and Kentucky fried quail are standouts, but you’d really ought to order the Whiskey King: a 10 oz patty of ground-to-order sustainable angus topped with maple bourbon glazed cipollini, Rogue blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon and foie gras. Bring your appetite.</p>
<h3>Cocktails </h3>
<p>	Whiskey-based cocktails are divided into two categories: Prohibition (classic cocktails) and Repeal (more contemporary, modern takes). Meanwhile, the venerable Manhattan is a mainstay, mixed using house-made bitters.</p>
<p>	Prohibition cocktails include: Old Fashioned (Bottle in Bond Bourbon and house bitters); Aviation (Creme de Violette and gin); and Philadelphia Fish House Punch (dark rum, peach brandy and tea). Repeal cocktails include: APA (hops-infused vodka, ginger and egg white); De Riguer (rye, aperol, grapefruit and mint); and Horse With No Name (scotch, Stone Pine Liqueur and pineapple).</p>
<h3>Atmosphere </h3>
<p>	The speakeasy atmosphere is accomplished through dim lighting, posters for various alcohols, a tin ceiling and antique mirrors. Black-and-white white tiled floors, marble topped tables and wooden drink rails add to the traditional bar decor.</p>
<p>	Behind the pewter bar, whiskies are proudly displayed like leather-bound books.</p>
<p>	During the warmer months, diners can sit at large, wooden tables placed along Sansom Street for whiskey alfresco.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Experience </h3>
<p>	The Liberty Bell has a new home, and it is as powerful and dramatic as the Bell itself. Throughout the expansive, light-filled Center, larger-than-life historic documents and graphic images explore the facts and the myths surrounding the Bell.</p>
<p>	X-rays give an insider&acute;s view, literally, of the Bell&acute;s crack and inner-workings. In quiet alcoves, a short History Channel film, available in English and eight other languages, traces how abolitionists, suffragists and other groups adopted the Bell as its symbol of freedom.</p>
<p>	Other exhibits show how the Bell&acute;s image was used on everything from ice cream molds to wind chimes. Keep your camera handy. Soaring glass walls offer dramatic and powerful views of both the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, just a few steps away.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>	The bell now called the Liberty Bell was cast in the Whitechapel Foundry in the East End of London and sent to the building currently known as Independence Hall, then the Pennsylvania State House, in 1753.</p>
<p>	It was an impressive looking object, 12 feet in circumference around the lip with a 44-pound clapper. Inscribed at the top was part of a Biblical verse from Leviticus, “Proclaim Liberty throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants thereof.”</p>
<p>	Unfortunately, the clapper cracked the bell on its first use. A couple of local artisans, John Pass and John Stow, recast the bell twice, once adding more copper to make it less brittle and then adding silver to sweeten its tone. No one was quite satisfied, but it was put in the tower of the State House anyway.</p>
<h3>Fast Facts </h3>
<p>	The Liberty Bell is composed of approximately 70 percent copper, 25 percent tin and traces of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold and silver.</p>
<p>	The Bell is suspended from what is believed to be its original yoke, made of American elm.</p>
<p>	The Liberty Bell weighs 2,080 pounds. The yoke weighs about 100 pounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Experience</h3>
<p>	It only four pages long, but the U.S. Constitution is among the most influential and important documents in the history of the world.</p>
<p>	The 160,000-square-foot National Constitution Center explores and explains this amazing document through high-tech exhibits, artifacts, and interactive displays. The Kimmel Theater, a 350-seat star-shaped theater, features Freedom Rising, a multimedia production combining film, a live actor and video projection on a 360° screen to tell the stirring story of We the people.</p>
<p>	Then experience it yourself: don judicial robes to render your opinion on key Supreme Court cases, then take the Presidential oath of the office.</p>
<p>	In Signers Hall, where life-size bronze figures of the Constitution&acute;s signers and dissenters are displayed, visitors can choose to sign or dissent.</p>
<p>	One of the rare original public copies of the Constitution is on display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>New Location! </h3>
<p>		Who doesn&acute;t love the Please Touch Museum? And now, taking kids to the Museum is better than ever. The nation&acute;s premier children&acute;s museum &#8211; which has been a beloved landmark since it opened in 1976 &#8211; has a new home in Fairmount Park, opening its doors to a world of educational, hands-on fun.</p>
<p>		The new location in Memorial Hall &#8211; a National Historic Landmark built in 1876 for the Centennial Exhibition celebrating the country&acute;s 100th birthday &#8211; will boast three times more space for exhibitions and programs.</p>
<p>		Just outside the museum, kids and adults will also delight in riding the meticulously restored 1908 Woodside Park Dentzel Carousel, built in Philadelphia for a now-defunct amusement park 10 blocks from Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>		Visit The Please Touch Museum for more info!</p>
<h3>The Experience </h3>
<p>		The city&acute;s award-winning children&acute;s museum is fun-filled, totally hands-on, and so delightful that adults are entertained, too. Each nook and cranny has a different theme &#8211; from the fantastic to the practical. In Alice&acute;s Adventures in Wonderland, kids can play croquet with the Queen and sip tea with the Mad Hatter; nearby, oversized props bring Maurice Sendak&acute;s classics to life.</p>
<p>		Kids can take the wheel of a real bus and sail a boat on a mini-Delaware River; in “Nature&acute;s Pond,” the youngest visitors (age 3 and under) can discover animals nestled among high grass and a lily pond, or enjoy stories and nursery rhymes in “Fairytale Garden.” Please Touch is also a first live theater experience for young children &#8211; Please Touch Playhouse performances are original and interactive and take place daily!</p>
<p>		Please Touch Museum tends to be busier on rainy days. You may want to schedule your visit on fair weather days. Mornings are also a busy time with most school groups visiting during this time. Afternoons are a great time to visit the museum as well as Mondays when groups are not scheduled.</p>
<h3>History </h3>
<p>		One of the lasting museums from the tourist upgrade of Philadelphia that coincided with the 1976 Bicentennial celebration, Please Touch Museum® filled a gap in the city&acute;s cultural scene. Other museums in the area certainly have sections for children, but Please Touch Museum&acute;s new home not only offers three toddler areas, but also exciting exhibit components for older siblings (for ages 7 and up).</p>
<h3>Visiting Tips </h3>
<p>		Please Touch Museum tends to be busier on rainy days. You may want to schedule your visit on fair weather days. Mornings are also a busy time with most school groups visiting during this time. Afternoons are a great time to visit the museum as well as Mondays when groups are not scheduled.</p>
<h3>Insider Tip </h3>
<p>		The museum has a full schedule of craft activities and music, dance and storytelling performances, which are entertaining for both kids and adults.</p>
<h3>Great Kids’ Stuff </h3>
<p>		In The Supermarket, kids take control: They can stock the shelves, load their cart and ring up the order.<br />

<h3> Location </h3>
<p>		6th and Race Streets in Historic Philadelphia</p>
<h3>The Experience</h3>
<p>		One of Philadelphia&acute;s newest historic attractions is also one of its oldest.</p>
<p>		Franklin Square, one of the five public squares that William Penn laid out in his original plan for the city, has undergone a dramatic renovation.</p>
<p>		The park now boasts several all new, family-friendly attractions, including a miniature golf course, a classic carousel, storytelling benches, a picnic area and more.</p>
<h3>Mini Golf </h3>
<p>		At Philly Mini Golf, an 18-hole miniature golf course decorated with some of Philadelphia&acute;s favorite icons, play a round of putt-putt and learn a little history at the same time.</p>
<h3>Carousel </h3>
<p>		Close your eyes and take a nostalgic ride on the Philadelphia Park Liberty Carousel, a classic tribute to Philadelphia&acute;s great heritage of carousel-making. It&acute;s sure to be a instant kid favorite.<br />
		Storytelling Benches</p>
<p>		Then catch up on your history at one of the storytelling benches located throughout the park, where you can hear tales of Franklin Square&acute;s past, or learn about the many communities touched by the Square, courtesy of the friendly storytellers of Once Upon a Nation.</p>
<h3>Fountain</h3>
<p>		And emanating from the corners of the historic park, four new herringbone brick walking paths with nighttime lighting bring even more charm to the Square after dark. The paths lead to the centerpiece of the Square, the Franklin Square Fountain, a marble masterpiece built in 1838 surrounded by wrought iron fences, which is currently still going under cosmetic restoration.</p>
<h3>The History </h3>
<p>		Originally named “North East Publick Square,” the 7.5-acre green is one of five original squares that William Penn laid out in his original plan of the city in 1682. The Square was renamed in honor of Benjamin Franklin in 1825.</p>
<p>		Over the years, the area has been used as a cattle pasture, a horse and cattle market, a burial ground, a drill and parade ground for the American military during the War of 1812 and, finally, a city park.</p>
<p>		In 1837, the city made Franklin Square into a public park and an elegant fountain was constructed in its center, a fountain thought to be the oldest surviving fountain in William Penn&acute;s five historic squares. The others are Rittenhouse, Washington, Logan and Center Square, where City Hall is now located.</p>
<h3>SquareBurger </h3>
<p>		Just in time for summer, Franklin Square has opened SquareBurger, a Stephen Starr-run “burger shack” selling summer staples: hot dogs, fries, milkshakes (made with Tasty Kakes) and, of course, hamburgers and cheeseburgers.</p>
<p>		SquareBurger is open until October &#8211; perfect for a couple bites between rounds of miniature golf!</p>
