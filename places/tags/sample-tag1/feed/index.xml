										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Percy Street Barbecue sees the South Street debut of restaurateurs Steven Cook and Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Xochitl).</p>
<p>	Serving a straightforward selection of slowly smoked meats and homey side dishes alongside craft beers and tasty cocktails, Percy Street is an ideal venue for Chef Erin OShea much-lauded Southern cooking, and is on its way to become the city top spot for barbecue.</p>
<p>	Working with J&#038;R smokers sourced from Texas, Chef O&acute;shea and her crack team of barbecue wizards headed down to Texas &#8211; tested no fewer than 20 beef briskets &#8211; as they perfected the ideal balance of salt, smoke and seasoning. Check out this video about their culinary field trip to the Lone Star State.</p>
<h3>The Eats </h3>
<p>	That Brisket which is Percy Street&acute;s signature dish, served &#8211; as is the custom in Texas &#8211; by the half pound or pound, in three distinct cuts: Moist, Lean and Burnt Ends.</p>
<p>	Other menu items include: Spare Ribs; house-made Sausage; half or whole Chicken; and Pork Belly, all slowly smoked and served with white bread and pickles. Sides, available small or large, include: Pinto Beans; Green Bean Casserole, Root beer Chili, Coleslaw; Collard Greens; Macaroni and Cheese; and Vegan Chili.</p>
<h3>The Drinks </h3>
<p>	In keeping with their bare-bones, Texas-frontier aesthetic, Percy Street&acute;s craft beers are served exclusively on draft at the poured concrete bar, lit from above by illuminated green glass beer growlers. Beers include Sly Fox Rauchbier (available in Pennsylvania exclusively at the restaurant) as well as a hand-crafted Root Beer from Yard&acute;s Brewing Company.</p>
<p>	Cocktails include: FM 423, with Tito handmade vodka, peach juice and sweet tea; Jack &#038; Ginger, with Jack Daniels, Canton ginger liqueur, lime cordial and ginger ale; and Cherry Cola, with Beam rye, cherry Heering, DiSaronno and cola.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere </h3>
<p>	Percy Street&acute;s simple, rustic decor was created by Elisabeth Knapp, who also designed Cook and Solomonov Xochitl and Zahav restaurants.</p>
<p>	Her frontier-influenced design focuses on the fire engine red smokers, visible through a window in the dining room and bar area. The restaurant features light wood floors, weathered red paint, a working jukebox and custom “blackboard walls,” large panels of schoolhouse blackboards that can be rearranged to create private dining areas throughout the 80-seat space.</p>
<p>	Seating in the form of repurposed church pews, and bare light bulbs overhead in the dining room lend to the restaurant Texas-esque aesthetic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	If you love Paris in the springtime, Parc is a veritable grand cru.</p>
<p>	With Parc, famed restaurateur Stephen Starr brings a certain je ne sais quoi to Rittenhouse Square. Parc offers an authentic French bistro experience, fully equipped with a chic Parisian ambiance and gorgeous sidewalk seating overlooking the Square.</p>
<h3>Cuisine </h3>
<p>	Parc menu encourages a joyful dining experience, where croissants, champagne and conversation are enjoyed in equal measure.</p>
<p>	Sample hors d’oeuvres include salade lyonnaise with warm bacon vinaigrette and poached egg, escargots served in their shells with hazelnut butter and a crispy duck confit with frisée salad and pickled chanterelles.</p>
<p>	Outstanding entrées include boeuf bourguignon with fresh buttered pasta and steak frites with peppercorn sauce. A variety of plats du jour are also offered, including a seafood-rich bouillabaisse on Fridays and a sumptuous coq au vin, perfect for Sunday night suppers.</p>
<p>	And what&acute;s an authentic French meal without wine? More than 160 expertly chosen varietals are offered by the bottle, with more than 20 available by the glass.</p>
<h3>See and Be Seen </h3>
<p>	With seating for more than 75 at its sidewalk and window seating, Parc has instantly become one of the best places in Philadelphia for alfresco drinking and dining.</p>
<p>	The awning-covered seating wraps around the restaurant&acute;s two sides and overlooks Rittenhouse Square, one of Philadelphia&acute;s most popular public spaces.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere </h3>
<p>	The aroma of freshly baked breads fills the air as one enters Parc&acute;s casual front room, which is clad in hand-laid Parisian tiles in shades of ecru and green.</p>
<p>	Red leather banquettes flanked by frosted glass offer subtle intimacy, while well-worn wooden chairs, reclaimed bistro tables and mahogany paneled walls give the room a sense of place.</p>
<p>	The more formal dining room provides a slightly more sophisticated experience while maintaining the energy and emotion of a bustling brasserie.</p>
<p>	To put it simply, Parc is nothing short of an authentic Parisian dining experience &#8211; right here in the heart of Rittenhouse Square.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Zavino is a new pizzeria and wine bar located at the epicenter of the city&acute;s trendy Midtown Village neighborhood. The restaurant features a seasonal menu, classic cocktails, an approachable selection of wine and beer and some of the best late night menu offerings in the area.</p>
<p>	The restaurant&acute;s interior looks great &#8211; it has a simple, rustic feel with an original brick wall, large picture windows, a long bar and a large outdoor cafe coming this spring.</p>
<p>	And the menu is great too &#8211; it boasts affordable snacks ranging from pizza to pasta to charcuterie to satisfy diners’ hunger, and then cocktails, including Italy&acute;s venerable Negroni and Bellini, and an ever-evolving assortment of wine and beer offerings, to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>	Menu items vary seasonally, as is customary in Italy, and may include: House-Made Beef Ravioli with brown butter and sage; Roasted Red and Golden Beets with pistachios and goat cheese; Roasted Lamb with fried eggplant and mint; a delicious house-made gnocchi; and traditional Panzanella, a tomato and bread salad. There is also a nice selection of cheese and charcuterie available a la carte.</p>
<h3>The Pizza </h3>
<p>	The gourmet pizzas are baked in a special wood-burning oven that reaches temperatures of up to 900 degrees. The pizzas are approximately 12 inches in diameter. And Chef Gonzalez describes the crust as neither too thin or too thick, but rather somewhere right between Neapolitan and Sicilian, “crunchy and tender, and just exactly right.”</p>
<p>	Three classic pizzas will be available year-round: Rosa, with tomato sauce and roasted garlic; Margherita, with tomato sauce and buffalo mozzarella, topped with fresh basil; and Polpettini, tomato sauce and provolone cheese with veal mini-meatballs.</p>
<p>	The specialty pizzas that are on the opening winter menu include: Philly, with bechamel, provolone, roasted onions and bresaola; Kennett, with bechamel, claudio&acute;s mozzarella, roasted onions with oyster, cremini and shitake mushrooms; Sopressata, with tomato sauce, claudio&acute;s mozzarella, sopressata olives, pickled red onion and pecorino; and Fratello, with bechamel, broccoli, roasted garlic and claudio&acute;s mozzarella.</p>
<p>	Pizzas vary in price from $8 to $12.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	Located in a Rittenhouse Square space evoking the free-wheeling spirit of a speakeasy, Village Whiskey is prolific Chef Jose Garces’ intimate, 30-seat tribute to the time-honored liquor.</p>
<p>	In fact, Village Whiskey features a veritable library of 80-100 varieties of whiskey, bourbon, rye and scotch from Scotland, Canada, Ireland, United States and even Japan.</p>
<p>	Much as Village Whiskey could be a scene for toasting and roasting, it also comes from the culinary imagination of Jose Garces (of Amada, Tinto, Distrito and Chifa fame), meaning the food is no less than outstanding.</p>
<h3>Cuisine </h3>
<p>	Village Whiskey&acute;s specialty from the kitchen is “bar snacks,” but that doesn&acute;t mean a bowl of cashews. Rather, it means deviled eggs, spicy popcorn shrimp, soft pretzels and an à la carte raw bar, all treated with the culinary care that made Jose Garces a finalist on The Next Iron Chef.</p>
<p>	Perhaps you seek something heartier. The lobster roll, raw bar selections and Kentucky fried quail are standouts, but you’d really ought to order the Whiskey King: a 10 oz patty of ground-to-order sustainable angus topped with maple bourbon glazed cipollini, Rogue blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon and foie gras. Bring your appetite.</p>
<h3>Cocktails </h3>
<p>	Whiskey-based cocktails are divided into two categories: Prohibition (classic cocktails) and Repeal (more contemporary, modern takes). Meanwhile, the venerable Manhattan is a mainstay, mixed using house-made bitters.</p>
<p>	Prohibition cocktails include: Old Fashioned (Bottle in Bond Bourbon and house bitters); Aviation (Creme de Violette and gin); and Philadelphia Fish House Punch (dark rum, peach brandy and tea). Repeal cocktails include: APA (hops-infused vodka, ginger and egg white); De Riguer (rye, aperol, grapefruit and mint); and Horse With No Name (scotch, Stone Pine Liqueur and pineapple).</p>
<h3>Atmosphere </h3>
<p>	The speakeasy atmosphere is accomplished through dim lighting, posters for various alcohols, a tin ceiling and antique mirrors. Black-and-white white tiled floors, marble topped tables and wooden drink rails add to the traditional bar decor.</p>
<p>	Behind the pewter bar, whiskies are proudly displayed like leather-bound books.</p>
<p>	During the warmer months, diners can sit at large, wooden tables placed along Sansom Street for whiskey alfresco.</p>
