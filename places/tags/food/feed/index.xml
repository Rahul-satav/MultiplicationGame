										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	A deluxe hotel like The Rittenhouse deserves a deluxe restaurant, a fitting description for Lacroix, named “Restaurant of the Year” in 2003 by Esquire magazine.</p>
<p>	Located on the second floor of the Rittenhouse Hotel, Lacroix features elegant décor and a broad view of Rittenhouse Square, which combine to make the ambiance at Lacroix as enjoyable as the meal itself.</p>
<p>	The creative French menu changes with the season and in the past has included favorites like pumpkin soup with fried shallots and tuna steak with salmis sauce. The wine list is excellent and extensive &#8211; thanks to the 4,000-bottle wine cellar .</p>
<p>	The tasting menus can be catered to your preference &#8211; three-, four- and five-course selections are offered at set prices during lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>	Sunday Brunch at Lacroix &#8211; which features such delectable dishes as baby lamb chops with garlic crust and banyuls sauce, niman ranch smoked bacon, quail eggs with artichoke, golden beet and shiitakes, and french baguette toast with apple, raspberry and rosemary jam &#8211; is also highly recommended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>	The Fountain Restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia has received seemingly every type of accolade there is, from top honors in Gourmet magazine to Forbes Travel Guide&acute;s 2010 Five Star award to a perfect Five Diamond rating from AAA. It&acute;s been a Philadelphia favorite for special occasion meals for decades.</p>
<p>	Additionally rated as the best restaurant in Philadelphia by Zagat&acute;s, the Fountain Restaurant overlooks the majestic Swann Memorial Fountain sculpture by Alexander Stirling Calder in the center of Logan Square. You&acute;ll also enjoy sweeping views of the grand Benjamin Franklin Parkway and its gorgeous Beaux Arts architecture.</p>
<p>	Fountain is definitely an incredibly romantic restaurant, so if you&acute;re visiting with a special someone, you will surely impress them with a meal at Fountain.</p>
<p>	You can order a la carte or select the prix fix option to enjoy the “spontaneous tastes” menu which gives the chef control of a few courses. The menu changes regularly, but you can expect to see globaly influenced items like Pan-fried Veal Sweetbreads, Braised Dover Sole Roulade, Sautéed Venison Medallions and Roasted Australian Lamb Saddle.</p>
