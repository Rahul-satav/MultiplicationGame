										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Experience</h3>
<p>	It only four pages long, but the U.S. Constitution is among the most influential and important documents in the history of the world.</p>
<p>	The 160,000-square-foot National Constitution Center explores and explains this amazing document through high-tech exhibits, artifacts, and interactive displays. The Kimmel Theater, a 350-seat star-shaped theater, features Freedom Rising, a multimedia production combining film, a live actor and video projection on a 360Â° screen to tell the stirring story of We the people.</p>
<p>	Then experience it yourself: don judicial robes to render your opinion on key Supreme Court cases, then take the Presidential oath of the office.</p>
<p>	In Signers Hall, where life-size bronze figures of the Constitution&acute;s signers and dissenters are displayed, visitors can choose to sign or dissent.</p>
<p>	One of the rare original public copies of the Constitution is on display.</p>
<h3>History </h3>
<p>	Freedom of speech, protection from unlawful search and seizure, and other individual rights were not part of the original Constitution. Recognizing its imperfections, the authors built in a mechanism to amend the Constitution, making it adaptable for unknown eventualities.</p>
<p>	The first ten amendments guaranteeing numerous personal freedoms &#8211; The Bill of Rights &#8211; were not ratified until 1791.</p>
<h3>Insider Tip </h3>
<p>	While the Center hosts amazing evergreen presentations, take a look at the Events Calendar for the latest premiere or traveling exhibit.</p>
<h3>Kids Stuff </h3>
<p>	The Center frequently hosts special events with a focus on children that include informative and engaging hands-on activities. For specific information, check out the Center website.</p>
